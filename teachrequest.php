  <p>Kids College at Western Oklahoma State College provides learning opportunities for the youth 
  in our service area. This unique program offers children and teens academic and enrichment workshops on a college campus.
  Kids College workshops are designed to teach new and meaningful skills,
  develop new interests and hobbies, excite students about learning, as well as provide an opportunity for them to explore possible careers.</p>
  <p>Kids College workshops (fee-based, not-for-credit) are provided during the summer term June 6th through June 30th.   Each workshop is individually priced based on the total
   number of classroom hours and the maximum number of students.  They are scheduled based on the availability of 
   classroom facilities and teachers. Materials are generally figured into the cost of the program.</p>
